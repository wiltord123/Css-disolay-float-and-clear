It stretches lazily in a sunbeam, its eyes half-closed in contentment, as if the whole world belongs to it. With a flick of its tail, it darts off to explore a new hiding spot or to chase an imaginary prey, always retaining that mysterious allure that makes it both enigmatic and endearing to its human companions.</p>
